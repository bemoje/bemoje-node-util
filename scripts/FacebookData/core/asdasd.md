Conversational topics or categories can be thought of as a hierarchy - a kind of tree structure. Some categories are sub-categories of other categories. For example, the categories of 'calculus' is a sub-category of 'mathematics' and 'mathematics' itself is a sub-category of 'natural sciences'.

You will be given a list of categories. For each categories, try to determine if any of the other categories are sub-categories of it.

Respond with a table like this one:

| category | sub-categories |
| -------- | -------------- |
|          |                |
